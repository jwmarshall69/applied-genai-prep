# Week 1 Checklist — Generative AI Landscape

## Outcomes for Week 1
By the end of Week 1, you should be able to explain:
- What tokens and embeddings are (and why both exist)
- Why LLMs hallucinate (and when it matters)
- What “self-attention” is at a high level
- Practical GenAI business uses (and the risks)

---

## Checklist (do these in order)

### A) Build your mental model
- [ ] Write a 10–15 sentence explanation of how an LLM produces text (no buzzwords).
- [ ] Define: token, context window, embedding, attention, transformer, temperature.
- [ ] Add one concrete example for each definition.

### B) Run prompt experiments (10 total)
- [ ] Create an experiment log (use `docs/notes/week01.md`).
- [ ] Run 10 experiments using `src/week01_genai_landscape/starter_prompts.md`.
- [ ] For each experiment: record the prompt, the observed behavior, and 1 mitigation.

### C) Create a Week 1 glossary (20 terms)
- [ ] Fill `src/week01_genai_landscape/glossary.csv` with 20 terms.
- [ ] Each term includes: definition + “why it matters” + example.

### D) Write the executive memo (1 page)
- [ ] Fill `docs/notes/week01_memo.md` using the template.
- [ ] Include 3 industries + 3 workflows + 3 risks + 3 mitigations.

### E) Checkpoint
- [ ] In `docs/notes/week01.md`, write a 5-bullet “What I now understand” section.
- [ ] Commit your work with message: `week01: genai landscape artifacts`
