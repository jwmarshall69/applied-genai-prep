## Purpose
This week is about building an accurate mental model of how LLMs behave. You will run prompt experiments, observe patterns, and document mitigation strategies.

## What to do
1. Open `starter_prompts.md` and run 10 experiments.
2. Record results in `../../docs/notes/week01.md`.
3. Build a glossary in `glossary.csv`.
4. Write the executive memo in `../../docs/notes/week01_memo.md`.

## Done looks like
- Week 1 notes completed
- 10 experiments logged
- 20-term glossary filled
- Memo completed
