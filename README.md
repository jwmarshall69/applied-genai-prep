# Applied Generative AI – Preparation Course

## Overview
This repository is a **16-week preparation program** designed to get you fully ready for the *Applied Generative AI* certification course. The goal is to ensure you enter the course already fluent in Python-assisted AI workflows, LLM fundamentals, prompt engineering, RAG systems, and agentic architectures.

This is not a passive learning repo. Every week produces **working code, documentation, and evaluatable artifacts**.

---

## Learning Philosophy (Opinionated)
- Generative AI is **software engineering + systems thinking**, not prompt guessing.
- Understanding *why models behave the way they do* matters more than memorizing APIs.
- Documentation is treated as a **first-class artifact**, not an afterthought.

You should finish this repo confident explaining, building, and evaluating GenAI systems—not just using them.

## Weekly Progress Model
Each week follows the same discipline:
1. **Concepts** – written understanding in `docs/notes/`
2. **Hands-on Lab** – executable code in `src/`
3. **Evaluation** – results, metrics, or reflections
4. **Checkpoint** – short summary of what you now understand

If a week feels weak, you repeat it. No rushing.

---

## Week 1 – Generative AI Landscape (Current)
**Focus:** How LLMs work, why they behave the way they do, and where they succeed or fail.

### Deliverables
- Prompt behavior experiment log
- Glossary of GenAI terms
- 1-page executive-style memo on business use cases

```

---

## Environment Setup (Lightweight)
You do *not* need GPUs or heavy ML tooling for Weeks 1–4.

Recommended:
- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment
- VS Code

Later weeks will introduce additional libraries incrementally.

---

## How to Use This Repo
- Treat this like a **professional engineering notebook**
- Commit weekly
- Write README updates for projects
- Favor clarity over cleverness

This repo should be portfolio-grade by Week 16.

---

## Success Criteria
By the end of this preparation course, you should be able to:
- Explain LLM behavior without buzzwords
- Build and evaluate GenAI pipelines
- Implement RAG and agents responsibly
- Document AI systems clearly and professionally

If you can teach it, you’ve learned it.
